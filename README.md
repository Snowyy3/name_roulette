## **🤔 Why Choose Name Roulette?**

<ins>Let's face it:</ins>  The need for random and fair selections arises constantly in various settings. Traditional methods, like picking based on dates or subjective preferences, can be time-consuming, inefficient, and prone to bias. 

**Name Roulette was born from a genuine pain point experienced by educators like our Basic Programming for Data Science teacher, Nguyen Tuan Long.** In his quest to engage students and ensure fairness during classroom activities, Mr. Long found himself frequently needing to select students randomly – for answering questions, participating in exercises, or forming groups for discussions and projects. 

Existing solutions proved inadequate. Manual selection methods were cumbersome and time-consuming, while readily available tools lacked the desired flexibility and control. Mr. Long resorted to using a Jupyter Notebook file, a solution that, while functional, was not readily accessible or user-friendly for other teachers or individuals facing similar challenges, as well as lacking the ability to fine-tune the selection process as he so desired.

**This experience highlighted a glaring gap in the market:** a lack of readily available, user-friendly, and feature-rich tools specifically designed to facilitate random name selection and group formation. Name Roulette emerged as a direct response to this need, aiming to empower educators, project managers, and anyone seeking a fair and efficient way to make random selections. 

**Name Roulette is more than just a random name picker – it's a solution born from a real-world challenge, designed to make a tangible difference in classrooms, workplaces, and beyond.**
