# Project Planning: Name Roulette

## **A. Major Milestones:**

1.  **Core Functionality Development:**
    -   **Name Dataset Management:**
        -   Decide on the format and source of the name dataset (e.g., CSV, JSON, web scraping).
        -   Implement functions to load, parse, and store the dataset in a suitable data structure (e.g., Pandas DataFrame, list of dictionaries).
    -   **Random Name Generation:**
        -   Develop algorithms for generating random names based on user-specified criteria (number of names, gender filters, attribute filters).
    -   **Group Generation:**
        -   Implement algorithms for creating balanced groups based on user-defined parameters (number of groups, group size, gender distribution, representative picking).

2.  **User Interface (UI) Development:**
    -   **UI Framework Selection:** Choose a suitable Python UI framework (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy) based on project requirements and team expertise.
    -   **UI Design and Implementation:** Design and implement the user interface, including:
        -   Input fields for user parameters (number of names, group size, filters).
        -   Output display for generated names and groups.
        -   Intuitive controls and navigation.

3.  **Testing and Refinement:**
    -   **Unit Testing:** Develop unit tests to ensure the correctness of core functionalities (name generation, group generation).
    -   **Integration Testing:** Test the integration between the UI and core functionalities.
    -   **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Gather feedback from potential users and refine the application based on their input.

4.  **Documentation and Deployment:**
    -   **User Manual:** Create a user manual or help documentation explaining how to use the application.
    -   **Code Documentation:** Document the code using comments and docstrings.
    -   **Deployment:** Explore options for deploying the application (e.g., creating an executable, packaging for distribution).


### **Python Libraries** *(options, not 100% required)*

-   **Data Manipulation:**
    -   Pandas: For efficient data loading, manipulation, and filtering.
-   **UI Development:**
    -   Tkinter: A standard Python UI framework (beginner-friendly).
    -   PyQt: A more advanced and feature-rich UI framework.
    -   Kivy: A cross-platform UI framework suitable for mobile development.
-   **Randomization:**
    -   random: Python's built-in module for random number generation.
-   **Other Potential Libraries:**
    -   NumPy: For numerical operations (if needed for attribute-based filtering).
    -   Requests/Beautiful Soup: For web scraping (if needed for dynamic name dataset).


## **B. Comprehensive Task List**

1.  **Name Dataset Management:**
    -   Research and select a suitable name dataset source.

    -   Design and implement data storage structure.

2.  **Random Name Generation:**
    -   Implement basic random name generation without filters.
    -   Implement gender-based filtering.
    -   Implement attribute-based filtering (if applicable).

3.  **Group Generation:**
    -   Implement group generation based on the number of groups.
    -   Implement group generation based on group size.
    -   Implement gender distribution control within groups.
    -   Implement representative picking functionality.

4.  **UI Development:**
    -   Select a UI framework.
    -   Design the UI layout and elements.
    -   Implement input fields and controls.
    -   Implement output display for names and groups.
    -   Connect UI elements to core functionalities.

5.  **Testing:**
    -   Write unit tests for name generation and group generation.
    -   Conduct integration testing between UI and core functionalities.
    -   Plan and execute user acceptance testing.

6.  **Documentation and Deployment:**
    -   Write a user manual or help documentation.
    -   Add code comments and docstrings.
    -   Research and select a deployment method.
    -   Package and deploy the application.


This comprehensive task list can be further broken down and assigned to team members based on their skills and interests. Remember to prioritize tasks based on their importance and dependencies.
