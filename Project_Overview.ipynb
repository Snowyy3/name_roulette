    "### 1. **High-Level Overview (MVC Adapted for Flet)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture is chosen for the Name Roulette application,well-suited for GUI applications, promotes modularity, maintainability, and testability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model:**\n",
    "    - Remains largely the same as in the previous design.\n",
    "    - Responsible for data management, name generation, group formation, and user authentication.\n",
    "- **View (Flet):**\n",
    "    - Implemented using Flet's declarative UI components.\n",
    "    - Defines the structure and layout of the user interface.\n",
    "    - Handles user interactions and events through Flet's event system.\n",
    "- **Controller:**\n",
    "    - Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.\n",
    "    - Receives events from the View (e.g., button clicks, text input changes).\n",
    "    - Updates the Model based on user actions.\n",
    "    - Updates the View by modifying the properties of Flet components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Key Components**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DataManager`: (Same as before) Handles loading, saving, and managing user data (accounts, lists, names) from the JSON file.\n",
    "- `NameGenerator`: (Same as before) Implements the logic for random name generation, including applying filters.\n",
    "- `GroupFormer`: (Same as before) Implements the logic for group formation, including handling uneven groups and balancing criteria.\n",
    "- `UserAuthenticationManager`: (Same as before) Handles user login and authentication (username/password, potentially Google Sign-In).\n",
    "\n",
    "**View (Flet):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MainView`:\n",
    "    - The main application view, containing the sidebar, content area, and top bar.\n",
    "    - Manages the navigation between different sections (Name Generation, Group Formation, List Management, User Accounts, Settings).\n",
    "- `NameGenerationView`:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Controller:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MainController`:\n",

    "    - Updates the `ListManagementView` to reflect the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Component Interactions (Example: Name Generation)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  User interacts with the `NameGenerationView` (enters names, selects filters).\n",
    "2.  `NameGenerationView` emits events (e.g., `on_change` for text fields, `on_click` for buttons).\n",
    "3.  `NameGenerationController` listens for these events.\n",
    "4.  `NameGenerationController` retrieves the data from the `NameGenerationView` components.\n",
    "5.  `NameGenerationController` calls the `generate_random_names` method of the `NameGenerator` in the Model, passing the input data.\n",
    "6.  `NameGenerator` returns the randomized list.\n",
    "7.  `NameGenerationController` updates the `NameGenerationView` components (e.g., `Column` or `ListView`) with the randomized list.\n",
    "8.  `NameGenerationController` (optionally) triggers the name highlighting animation using Flet's animation capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Data Structures**\n",
    "\n",
    "- User data (JSON): (Same as before) \n",
    "- Name list: List of dictionaries (same as before).\n",
    "- Group: List of lists (same as before).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Package the Python code and required Flet libraries into a single executable using a tool like PyInstaller.\n",
    "- Distribute the executable file on GitHub.\n",
    "- Users can run the executable, and a Flet app windows will open.\n",

    "    <summary>Alternative Architecture<br></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Alternative Architecture (Microservices)**\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative architecture to consider, especially if scalability becomes a significant concern in the future, is a **microservices architecture**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, the application would be broken down into smaller, independent services (e.g., Name Generation Service, Group Formation Service, User Authentication Service). These services would communicate with each other over a network, and each service could be scaled independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Microservices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Scalability:** Each service can be scaled independently to handle increased load.\n",
    "-   **Flexibility:** Services can be developed and deployed independently.\n",
    "-   **Technology Diversity:** Different services can use different technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Microservices:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Increased Complexity:**  More complex to develop and manage than a monolithic application.\n",
    "-   **Network Latency:** Communication between services can introduce latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this prototype, the MVC architecture is more appropriate due to its simplicity and ease of development. However, the microservices architecture could be a good option for future versions if scalability becomes a major requirement.**\n",
