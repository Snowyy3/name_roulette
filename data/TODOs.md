- Use filled (tonal) buttons for confirmation dialogues (such as make the Cancel button of Delete cf diag filled with red/blue, the Confirm button remains as is)
- Might change color of icons in existing ElevatedButtons
- Use dropdown with label and hint for lists selection
- Use Switch for toggle Light/Dark theme
- Change layout of header and sidebar



- Group former view:
  + fix drag interval bug (cái này tạm bỏ qua, fix sau)
  + manual selection not working


- # TODO: Major refactor of controllers and related logics (aside from login, sign up, user auth) - WIP
