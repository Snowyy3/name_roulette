A material design linear progress indicator, also known as a progress bar.

A control that shows progress along a line.

There are two kinds of linear progress indicators:

* *Determinate*. Determinate progress indicators have a specific value at each point in time, and the value should increase monotonically from `0.0` to `1.0`, at which time the indicator is complete. To create a determinate progress indicator, use a non-null value between `0.0` and `1.0`.
* *Indeterminate*. Indeterminate progress indicators do not have a specific value at each point in time and instead indicate that progress is being made without indicating how much progress remains. To create an indeterminate progress indicator, use a null value.

## Examples

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/displays/progressbar)

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
from time import sleep

import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    pb = ft.ProgressBar(width=400)

    page.add(
        ft.Text("Linear progress indicator", style="headlineSmall"),
        ft.Column([ ft.Text("Doing something..."), pb]),
        ft.Text("Indeterminate progress bar", style="headlineSmall"),
        ft.ProgressBar(width=400, color="amber", bgcolor="#eeeeee"),
    )

    for i in range(0, 101):
        pb.value = i * 0.01
        sleep(0.1)
        page.update()

ft.app(main)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Properties

### `value`

The value of this progress indicator. A value of `0.0` means no progress and `1.0` means that progress is complete. The
value will be clamped to be in the range `0.0` - `1.0`.

Defaults to `None`, meaning that this progress indicator is indeterminate - displays a predetermined animation that does
not indicate how much actual progress is being made.

### `bar_height`

The minimum height of the line used to draw the linear indicator.

Defaults to `4`.

### `border_radius`

The border radius of both the indicator and the track. Border radius is an instance
of [`BorderRadius`](/docs/reference/types/borderradius) class.

Defaults to `border_radius.all(0)` - rectangular shape.

### `bgcolor`

[Color](/docs/reference/colors) of the track being filled by the linear indicator.

### `color`

The progress indicator's [color](/docs/reference/colors).

### `semantics_label`

The [`Semantics.label`](/docs/controls/semantics#label) for this progress indicator.

### `semantics_value`

The [`Semantics.value`](/docs/controls/semantics#value) for this progress indicator.

### `tooltip`

The text displayed when hovering the mouse over the control.
