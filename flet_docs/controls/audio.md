A control to simultaneously play multiple audio files. Works on macOS, Linux, Windows, iOS, Android and web.
Based on [audioplayers](https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers) Flutter widget.

Audio control is non-visual and should be added to `page.overlay` list.

:::info Packaging
To build your Flet app that uses `Audio` control add `--include-packages flet_audio` to `flet build` command, for example:

```
flet build apk --include-packages flet_audio
```

## Examples

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/utility/audio)

### Autoplay audio

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

:::note
Autoplay works in desktop, mobile apps and Safari browser, but doesn't work in Chrome/Edge.
:::

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    audio1 = ft.Audio(
        src="https://luan.xyz/files/audio/ambient_c_motion.mp3", autoplay=True
    )
    page.overlay.append(audio1)
    page.add(
        ft.Text("This is an app with background audio."),
        ft.ElevatedButton("Stop playing", on_click=lambda _: audio1.pause()),
    )

ft.app(main)
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Audio with playback controls

Method arguments:

* `position_milliseconds` - desired position in milliseconds.

## Events

### `on_duration_changed`

Event handler argument is of type [`AudioDurationChangeEvent`](/docs/reference/types/audiodurationchangeevent).

### `on_loaded`

Fires when an audio is loaded/buffered.

### `on_position_changed`

Fires when audio position is changed. Will continuously update the position of the playback every 1 second if the status is playing. Can be used for a progress bar.

### `on_seek_complete`

Fires on seek completions. An event is going to be sent as soon as the audio seek is finished.

### `on_state_changed`

Fires when audio player state changes. 

Event handler argument is of type [`AudioStateChangeEvent`](/docs/reference/types/audiostatechangeevent).
