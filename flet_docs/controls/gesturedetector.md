A control that detects gestures.

Attempts to recognize gestures that correspond to its non-null callbacks.

If this control has a `content`, it defers to that child control for its sizing behavior. If it does not have a `content`, it grows to fit the parent instead.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Examples

[Live example](https://flet-controls-gallery.fly.dev/utility/gesturedetector)

[Solitare game tutorial](https://flet.dev/docs/tutorials/python-solitaire)

### Draggable containers

The following example demonstrates how a control can be freely dragged inside a Stack.

The sample also shows that GestureDetector can have a child control (blue container) as well as be nested inside another control (yellow container) giving the same results.

def main(page: ft.Page):
    def on_pan_update1(e: ft.DragUpdateEvent):
        c.top = max(0, c.top + e.delta_y)
        c.left = max(0, c.left + e.delta_x)
        c.update()

    def on_pan_update2(e: ft.DragUpdateEvent):

        e.control.left = max(0, e.control.left + e.delta_x)

## Properties

### `content`

A child Control contained by the gesture detector.

### `mouse_cursor`

The mouse cursor for mouse pointers that are hovering over the control.

Value is of type [`MouseCursor`](/docs/reference/types/mousecursor).

### `drag_interval`

Throttling in milliseconds for horizontal drag, vertical drag and pan update events. When a user moves a pointer a lot of events are being generated to do precise tracking. `drag_interval` allows sending drag update events to a Flet program every X milliseconds, thus preserving the bandwidth (web and mobile apps). Default is `0` - no throttling, all events are sent to a Flet program, very smooth tracking.

### `hover_interval`

Throttling in milliseconds for `on_hover` event.

## Events

### `multi_tap_touches`

The minimum number of pointers to trigger `on_multi_tap` event.
