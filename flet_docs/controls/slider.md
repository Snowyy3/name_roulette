A slider provides a visual indication of adjustable content, as well as the current setting in the total range of content.

Use a slider when you want people to set defined values (such as volume or brightness), or when people would benefit from instant feedback on the effect of setting changes.

## Properties

### `active_color`

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) to use for the portion of the slider track that is active.

The "active" side of the slider is the side between the thumb and the minimum value.

### `adaptive`

If the value is `True`, an adaptive Slider is created based on whether the target platform is iOS or macOS.

On iOS and macOS, a [`CupertinoSlider`](/docs/controls/cupertinoslider), which has matching functionality and presentation as `Slider`, and are the graphics expected on iOS. On other platforms, this creates a Material Slider.

Defaults to `False`.

### `autofocus`

True if the control will be selected as the initial focus. If there is more than one control on a page with autofocus set, then the first one added to the page will get focus.

### `divisions`

The number of discrete divisions.

Typically used with `label` to show the current discrete value.

If not set, the slider is continuous.

### `inactive_color`

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) for the inactive portion of the slider track.

The "inactive" side of the slider is the side between the thumb and the maximum value.

### `interaction`

The allowed way for the user to interact with this slider. Value is
a [`SliderInteraction`](/docs/reference/types/sliderinteraction) and defaults to `SliderInteraction.TAP_AND_SLIDE`.

### `label`

Format with `{value}`.

A label to show above the slider when the slider is active. The value of `label` may contain `{value}` which will be replaced with a current slider value.

It is used to display the value of a discrete slider, and it is displayed as part of the value indicator shape.

If not set, then the value indicator will not be displayed.

### `max`

The maximum value the user can select. Must be greater than or equal to `min`.

If the `max` is equal to the `min`, then the slider is disabled.

Defaults to `1.0`.

### `min`

The minimum value the user can select. Must be less than or equal to `max`.

If the `max` is equal to the `min`, then the slider is disabled.

Defaults to `0.0`.

### `mouse_cursor`

The cursor to be displayed when a mouse pointer enters or is hovering over this control.

Value is of type [`MouseCursor`](/docs/reference/types/mousecursor).

### `overlay_color`

The highlight [color](/docs/reference/colors) that's typically used to indicate that the range slider thumb is
in `ControlState.HOVERED` or `DRAGGED` [`ControlState`](/docs/reference/types/controlstate)s.

### `round`

The number of decimals displayed on the `label` containing `value`.

Defaults to `0`, which displays value rounded to the nearest integer.

### `secondary_active_color`

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) to use for the portion of the slider track between the thumb and the `secondary_track_value`.

### `secondary_track_value`

The secondary track value for this slider.

If not null, a secondary track using `secondary_active_color` is drawn between the thumb and this value, over the inactive track. If less than `value`, then the secondary track is not shown.

It can be ideal for media scenarios such as showing the buffering progress while the `value` shows the play progress.

### `thumb_color`

The [color](/docs/reference/colors) of the thumb.

### `value`

The currently selected value for this slider.

The slider's thumb is drawn at a position that corresponds to this value.

Defaults to value of `min` property.
