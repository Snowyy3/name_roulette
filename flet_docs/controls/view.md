View is the top most container for all other controls.

A root view is automatically created when a new user session started. From layout perspective the View represents
a [`Column`](/docs/controls/column) control, so it has a similar behavior and shares same properties.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Properties

### `appbar`

A [`AppBar`](/docs/controls/appbar) control to display at the top of the Page.

### `auto_scroll`

`True` if scrollbar should automatically move its position to the end when children updated. Must be `False`
for `scroll_to()` to work.

### `bgcolor`

Background [color](/docs/reference/colors) of the view.

### `controls`

A list of `Control`s to display on the Page.

For example, to add a new control to a page:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
page.controls.append(ft.Text("Hello!"))
page.update()
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

or to get the same result as above using `page.add()` shortcut method:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
page.add(ft.Text("Hello!"))
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To remove the top most control on the page:

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python" default>

```python
page.controls.pop()
page.update()
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
