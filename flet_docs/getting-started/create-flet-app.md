title: Create a new Flet app
---

To create a new "minimal" Flet app run the following command:

```
flet create <project-name>
```

for example:

```
flet create my_flet_app
```

`<project-name>` will be used as a name of output directory.

Flet will create `<project-name>` directory with the following `main.py`:

```python
import flet as ft

def main(page: ft.Page):
    page.add(ft.SafeArea(ft.Text("Hello, Flet!")))

ft.app(main)
```

:::note
To create your Flet app in current directory, run the following command:
```
flet create .
```
:::

Flet program has `main()` function where you would add UI elements ([controls](flet-controls)) to a page or a window. The application ends with a blocking `ft.app()` function which initializes Flet app and [runs](running-app) `main()`.

To create a new Flet app from "counter" template run the following command:

```
flet create --template counter <project-name>
```

Or, to create Flet app from counter template in your current directory, run this command:
```
flet create --template counter .
```

You can find more information about `flet create` command [here](/docs/reference/cli/create).

Now let's see Flet in action by [running the app](running-app)!
